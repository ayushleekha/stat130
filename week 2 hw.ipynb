    "Interacting with ChatBots to understand the Monte Hall problem was quite efficient. The ChatBot quickly provided a clear explanation of the problem, the probabilities involved, and the optimal strategy (switching doors). It also offered examples and simulations to illustrate the concept, which was very helpful. The ChatBot’s ability to break down complex probability concepts into simpler terms made the learning process smoother and more engaging.\n",

    "When it came to understanding the “Markovian ChatBot” code, the ChatBot was also quite helpful. It provided step-by-step explanations of the code, including the purpose of each function and how the Markov chains were implemented. The ChatBot’s ability to explain coding concepts in a detailed yet understandable manner was beneficial, especially for complex topics like Markov chains."
